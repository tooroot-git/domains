Design a premium, high-converting landing page dedicated to selling domain names. The page should combine modern design, persuasive copywriting, and interactive elements to maximize user engagement and conversions. Use advanced design techniques and psychological triggers to create urgency, establish trust, and guide the visitor toward purchasing the domain.

### 🏆 **Overall Design and Layout**  
- The page should have a sleek, professional look with a dark, luxurious background (e.g., deep navy or charcoal black) that exudes exclusivity.  
- The domain name should be displayed prominently in the center in extra-large, bold, white sans-serif font, instantly capturing attention.  
- Below the domain name, include a brief, persuasive tagline like:  
  *"Own this premium domain today – your brand deserves the best."*  

### 🛒 **Dynamic 'BUY NOW' Button (Main Call-to-Action)**  
- Display a large, visually striking button that reads **"BUY NOW"** and links to:  
  `https://www.dynadot.com/market/user-listings/{domain_name}`  
  (Replace `{domain_name}` dynamically using JavaScript based on the domain accessed.)  
- The button should be colored with high contrast (e.g., vibrant gold or electric blue) to draw the eye, with a hover effect that increases size and changes color slightly.  

### 💡 **Psychological Sales Triggers**  
- Create a sense of scarcity by displaying a small, animated text near the CTA button saying:  
  *"Limited availability – act now before it's taken!"*  
- Use trust-building elements below the button, such as:  
  ✅ *Secure checkout via Dynadot Marketplace*  
  ✅ *Fast, hassle-free domain transfer*  
  ✅ *Trusted by thousands of domain buyers worldwide*  

### 💬 **Interactive ChatGPT Sales Assistant (Built-in Sales Rep)**  
- Include a small, sleek chat widget that pops up 3 seconds after page load.  
- ChatGPT should introduce itself as the domain's personal sales assistant, immediately listing 3-4 key benefits of owning that domain. Example:  
  *"Hi! I’m your domain sales assistant for **{domain_name}**. This domain is perfect for boosting your brand's online presence. It's short, easy to remember, and SEO-friendly. Don’t miss your chance—feel free to ask me anything!"*  
- Allow visitors to send up to **4 messages** before ChatGPT politely informs them that the chat limit has been reached, maintaining urgency while avoiding abuse.  

### ⚙️ **Dynamic Elements**  
- Dynamically insert the domain name in all key elements, including the headline, CTA button, and chat widget.  
- Extract the domain name from the URL using JavaScript and seamlessly replace placeholders within the page.  

### 📱 **Responsive & Mobile-Optimized**  
- Ensure the page is fully responsive and looks stunning on both desktop and mobile devices.  
- Maintain the luxurious look on all screen sizes, with clean spacing and easy navigation.  

### 🚀 **Performance & SEO**  
- Optimize the page for lightning-fast loading using clean, minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Use proper meta tags, including dynamic insertion of the domain name for SEO purposes.  

### 💎 **Final Goal**  
This landing page should create an immediate sense of value and urgency, enticing visitors to click the "BUY NOW" button while providing a personalized touch through the ChatGPT sales assistant. The combination of persuasive copy, striking visuals, and dynamic elements should make the domain irresistible to potential buyers.
